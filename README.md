### Intro
As we are coding our software, we may inadvertently write some code that isn't correct. 
Text editors try to help us by notifying us of issues but they can't catch everything.
When we try to run this code, node.js will tell us that something is wrong.
It is very important that we understand the messages that node gives us to indicate what the problem is. 
These messages are consistent in the javascript world. They will be the same for node.js and the browser.
